Radon is a carcinogen—a naturally occurring radioactive gas whose decay products are also radioactive—known to cause lung cancer in high concentrations and estimated to cause several thousand lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. The distribution of radon levels in U.S. homes varies greatly, with some houses having dangerously high concentrations. To identify areas of high radon exposure, the Environmental Protection Agency coordinated radon measurements in a random sample of houses throughout the country.

The overall goal is to estimate the distribution of radon levels across U.S. counties, so that homeowners could make decisions about measuring or remediating the radon in their houses based on the best available knowledge of local conditions. For the purpose of this problem, we had an important predictor - whether the measurement was taken in a basement. (Radon comes from underground and can enter more easily when a house is built into the ground.) We also had an important county-level predictor - a measurement of soil uranium that
was available at the county level. In this problem we'll look at Minnesota, a state that contains 85 county's in which different measurements are taken, ranging from 2 till 80 measurements per county. Build a model to make predictions of radon levels based on the county data and the presence of a basement.
